Marianne came to New York City from Germany at 19, with $800 dollars, scholarships, and a decisive desire to follow in Gene Kelly’s footsteps. She starred in recurring TV roles on CVS dramas, became a ballroom champion, developed and stared in her first original work at 20 year-old off-off Broadway and even tangoed with [Antonio Banderas on The Late Show with David Letterman](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQfJ50zIQXU),%25C2%25A0after>), before she directed her first feature in 2009.

# “I want to write stories that I’m passionate about.”

In 2009, she wrote, directed and produced her first feature “[Mango Tango](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985056/?ref_=nv_sr_1%25C2%25A0)”, the story of “*a woman looking for her soulmate in all the wrong places*”. At the heart of her work, there’s a desire to speak to timely and fundamental themes:

> “I like to write about female protagonists who have their power taken away from them and who take that power back.”

Her second feature, *Prince Harming*, will make its debut on the festival circuit between the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. It has already been selected by several festivals.

# Finding distribution for Mango Tango

*Mango Tango* won a number of film festival awards in Europe and the US, including Best Director laurels at the Queens Independent Film Festival, and had a limited theatrical run in the US, Germany and Canada. But when it came to determining the long term future of her first movie, Marianne was left on somehow uncertain footing.

> “I was approached by a few distributors. They offered me no money upfront, I would probably have had to give away my rights to my film, and probably would have never seen a dime.”

That was when a friend of hers talked to her about [Filmhub](http://bit.ly/fhq_mariannehettinger), a new tech company which founding principles made it easy for independent, up-and-coming filmmakers like her to monetize their content while not having either to either pay nor give away their rights.

> “I thought “why not give it a shot?”. It sounded like a new thing. It was very simple to upload. The good thing is — I was able to keep my rights to the film, and they told me I could even pull it off the platform if I wanted to.”

# Ease of Use of the Platform

As for dealing with the platform itself, Marianne enjoys the peace of mind it brings her.

> “They always get back to me very quickly — it’s a simple process. You kind of forget about it and then a couple months later you get a check on Paypal.”

By lowering entry barriers for independent filmmakers like Marianne, Filmhub allows their title to compete in the same fields as bigger productions.

> “The cool thing is that Filmhub approaches different platforms and I can just wait and sit back and suddenly I get a call from a friend who says “Hey, your movie was movie of the week on TBD!”. It’s very helpful to have a platform that does the work for you.”

Her dual citizenship makes her appreciate that Filmhub can also showcase her movie in her native Germany.

> “They approach different platforms — worldwide now — the whole thing is spreading, it’s like snowballing. So instead of making less, I’m actually making a little more money.”

# Gaining Creative Autonomy

Marianne tackles heavy themes in her work — after *Mango Tango* and its exploration of emotional abuse, her next feature, *Prince Harming*, explores entrapment and the escalation of physical abuse in a romantic relationship. Herself a vocal sexual assault survivor, she feels the need to tackle those issues in her creative work.

[Filmhub](http://bit.ly/fhq_mariannehettinger) gives her this autonomy.

> “I feel like I can tell the stories I really wanna tell. No one tells me what story to make or censors me. I know I will have a platform where my films can get out there and it’s not gonna stay on a shelf.”
