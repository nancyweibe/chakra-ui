## Rift

*Directed by Erlingur Thoroddsen / Horror / 2017 / 111 mins / Iceland*

**Synopsis:** Gunnar receives a distraught phone call from his ex and drives up to a secluded cabin to see him. He discovers that there's more going on than he imagined and the two find that they are haunted by someone -- or something.

**What makes it special:** A gay-centric horror-thriller shot against the backdrop of Iceland's stark and magnificent landscapes. One of Icelandic cinema's rising stars, Thoroddsen took a Hitchcockian approach to tell an intimate story about a broken relationship in his second feature film.

## Is That You?

*Directed by Rudy Riverón Sánchez / Horror / 2018 / 107 mins / United Kingdom, Cuba*

**Synopsis:** When a teen's tyrannical father disappears, she uses a psychic's ritual to bring him back but instead uncovers the disturbing truth behind his disappearance.

**What makes it special:** The first psychological horror film made in Cuba is surprisingly slow-paced and sparse in dialogues, and doesn't resort to typical horror elements. Cuban native Riverón Sánchez's debut rewards patient viewers with a story far more disturbing than it appears at first.
