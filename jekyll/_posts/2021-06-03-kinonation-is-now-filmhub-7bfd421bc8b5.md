We are excited to announce our new name: **Filmhub**.

We’re growing fast, we launched our new platform, and we think this name shows better who we are: the go-to place for all filmmakers to get on streaming services worldwide – and for streaming services to find the best film and entertainment content from all over the world.

The team and our streaming service partners remain the same, with new streaming services joining all the time.

Our catalog keeps growing fast. New creators and catalog owners join daily.
