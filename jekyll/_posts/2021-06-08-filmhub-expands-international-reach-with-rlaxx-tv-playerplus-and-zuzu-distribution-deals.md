Film distribution disruptor **Filmhub** signs deals with Germany's ***rlaxx TV***, UK's ***PlayerPlus,*** and Canada's ***Zuzu***, expanding international distribution potential for its Filmmakers.

**Santa Monica, CA (6/7/21)** - Filmhub, the dynamic disruptor in the film distribution space, is excited to announce that they have closed three (3) new international distribution deals getting filmmakers further access to streaming services worldwide. rlaxx TV (Germany), PlayerPlus (United Kingdom), and Zuzu (Canada) are now utilizing Filmhub to license titles for their respective services.

"One of the keys to monetizing film in today's distribution landscape is being able to reach all streaming services as a filmmaker. These services are becoming increasingly fragmented around the world as they each develop their own unique brand and audience. By partnering with these services, we can increase the likelihood of a film's monetary success by bringing access to our filmmakers," says Filmhub CEO & Co-Founder Alan d'Escragnolle
