We want to thank you for your patience over the past months as you experienced longer than normal wait times for listing reviews. We’ve made significant progress optimizing our internal processes, updating documentation, and increasing our team size to help support the great influx of new titles we have seen over these trying times.

We’re happy to announce that we have consistently been at less than a 5-day turnaround time for all listing reviews over the past month and have the capacity to maintain this for the foreseeable future.

The goal of our listing review process is to make sure your title meets the visual and technical requirements of our 40+ Channel Partners. These requirements do change from time to time and sometimes we will message you to have updates made to your title. For instance — Channels are no longer accepting URLs in videos or billing blocks in key art. When we notify you of issues it is essential to have a quick turnaround of the fixes needed to make sure we can continue marketing your film to Channels and deliver the assets promptly.

Filmhub will never judge the content quality of your title in our listing review process. We only make sure your title meets the technical requirements of our Channel Partners.

If you have any new titles you’d like to submit — please go ahead and the team will review shortly!

Thank you,

The Filmhub Team
