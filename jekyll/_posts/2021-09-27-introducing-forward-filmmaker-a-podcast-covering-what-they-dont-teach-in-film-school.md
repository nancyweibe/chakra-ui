Klaus and Alan, Filmhub’s founders, here with an exciting update: We launched a podcast!

We started Filmhub with a vision: To bring the outdated model of film distribution into the 21st century. As Klaus learned firsthand composing music for 100+ films, including Pirates of the Caribbean, and Alan from working on cloud software in Silicon Valley, using technology to revolutionize Hollywood is the future. The Forward Filmmaker Podcast shares stories of filmmakers not only embracing but shaping that future. 

The first episode features award-winning writer-director Shaun Mathis. A former novelist who went to Atlanta on a whim after watching Entourage and pivoting into film, he has directed everything from crime features to documentaries to rom-coms. He has worked on 34 film projects…just in the last year.
