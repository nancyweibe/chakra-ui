> After decades of cross-pollinating with various genres and absorbing filmmaking traditions of other countries, the original definition of "noir" as 40s Hollywood crime dramas has become something trickier to define, but evermore fascinating. With many 21st century auteurs making their dent in the genre, we are now in a golden age of neo-noir. Here are 7 neo-noir gems in the Filmhub catalog.

**Synopsis:** As Dewi dives deeper into her assignment to search for a missing teenager, she goes head to head against the girl’s father, Hussein - a splitting image of her own husband. Dewi prides on being a sharp and intelligent detective, but how does she persevere.

**What makes it special:** An Asian noir and a women's noir, Motif is bold and memorable in every way. With a stunning portrait of Malaysia's tropical landscape, well-written and well-acted women characters who endure and rebel, it's an ambitious and dazzling debut for director Nadiah Hamzah, and we look forward to her future projects.
