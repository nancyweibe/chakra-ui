We’ve just implemented several new features to provide a much more streamlined submission workflow. Let’s take a quick look at what’s new.

**Submit for distribution**

When you’re done entering a title, you now submit it for distribution. This signals to us “you’re done” and starts the QC process.

**Title status**

A title has now a *status* on its path to the marketplace:

* *Edit* while you’re adding it
* *Submitted* after you *submit for distribution*
* *QC Pending* — running through technical checks
* *Fail* if something’s wrong. This is not final — we notify what is wrong and how to fix it.
* *Pass*: all good to go
