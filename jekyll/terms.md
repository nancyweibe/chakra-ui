Some most-asked questions:

1. **Am I signing over all distribution rights?** No.
    The only rights we take are the obvious ones we need to run the service.
    For example, the right to deliver the titles you upload to Channels on your behalf.
1. **Can I upload "unsold" titles only?** No. We operate **non-exclusive**ly. We can augment other distribution deals you might have with territories and streaming channels they don't cover. We just ask not to deliver to the same streaming channels. You can exclude specific streaming channels and territories per title.
1. **Am I tied into a long term contract?** No. You can withdraw your titles from Filmhub at any time, but remain bound to the rules of Channels already delivered to.

Now on to the binding [legal text](#filmhub-terms--conditions).

8.  DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT POLICY

    1. Notice and Takedown Procedure

        It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to  Filmhub as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the [U.S. Copyright Office Website](https://www.copyright.gov) but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well).

        It is expected that all users of any part of the Filmhub site will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if Filmhub receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.

        If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.

    1. Designated Agent

        Filmhub's Designated Agent for notification of alleged infringement under the DMCA is:

    Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyrights. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.

    1. Counter Notification

        A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To file a counter notification with us, please provide Filmhub’s Registered Agent (listed above) the following information in a written communication (preferably via email):
